###### I wonder what Star Wars reference should I put here ðŸ¤”

TLDR - I like: C++, gamedev, OpenGL/Vulkan.

Hi! My name is Mateusz ChÅ‚opek, I'm from Poland, Silesia.

Currently I'm working at **Code Horizon** as a game programmer. I've graduated from the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice. I love creating games and playing with low-level computer graphics - OpenGL/DirectX (although I'm still a beginner). In my free time I'm working on renderers or simple games in Unity or Unreal - all of that to gain even more experience.

Here is my GitHub profile, you can find there some projects I am or was working on during my studies/free time.
