###### I wonder what Star Wars reference should I put here ðŸ¤”

TLDR - I like: C++, gamedev, OpenGL/Vulkan.

Hi! My name is Mateusz ChÅ‚opek, I'm from Poland, Silesia.

I've graduated from the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice. I hope that in (near) future I will join the gamedev world as a programmer. I love creating games (as well as playing them!) and that's my dream. I aim at position like gameplay programmer as a begining but I would love to work on some graphic engines (low-level programming - OpenGL or Vulkan).

Here is my GitHub profile, you can find there some projects I am/was working on during my studies/free time.
